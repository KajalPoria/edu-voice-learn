## 🚀 Why EduWhiz Stands Out

EduWhiz doesn’t just teach — it **listens, understands, and motivates**.  
It blends **conversation, visualization, and narration** into one unified experience that feels more human than traditional e-learning apps.  
With every interaction, EduWhiz learns how you learn best — creating a truly personalized educational journey.
